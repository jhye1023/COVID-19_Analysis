# COVID-19 Analysis and Visualization
 
The goal of this project is tracking the global coronavirus outbreak



This page has a number of charts on the pandemic. In the box below you can select any country you are interested in – or several, if you want to compare countries.

The primary charts on this page will then show data for the countries that you selected.

What does the data on deaths and cases tell us about the mortality risk of COVID-19?
To understand the risks and respond appropriately we would also want to know the mortality risk of COVID-19 – the likelihood that someone who catches the disease will die from it.

We look into this question in more detail here and explain that this requires us to know – or estimate – the number of total cases and the final number of deaths for a given infected population. Because these are not known, we discuss what the current data can and can not tell us about the risk of death (here).
